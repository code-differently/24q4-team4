# Code Differently-24Q4Team4 Project Kanban(OOP Project)

### Members: Chigazo Graham, Shawn Dustmore Jr., Tommy Tran, and Zion Buchanan  

## Introduction

This project aims to address a real-world challenge by creating a scalable and maintainable software solution through **Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)** and **S.O.L.I.D.** design principles. Our focus is on building an application that promotes code reusability, effective collaboration, and adaptability to future needs.

Development will be conducted in Visual Studio Code created in Java, using Git and GitHub for version control to ensure efficient team management. We will follow the full development lifecycle, from ideation to implementation, prioritizing best practices in software design and development. Our final project submission will enable the functionality described by our user stories that can be found in the 'Issues' tab to guide our development process and ensure we meet the project requirements effectively.

## Project Requirements

-  All work must be submitted in our team's assigned GitHub repository.
-  The assignment can be completed in TypeScript or in Java.
-  Must include at least 5 types of objects with meaningful relationships to each other.
-  One of your objects must be a custom data structure that provides for adding, removing, and updating items in a collection.
-  Implement at least two custom exceptions.
-  Write unit tests achieving 90% code coverage (using JaCoCo for Java or Jest for Typescript).
-  Must include an integration test for each user story that demonstrates how your code implements the desired feature.
-  Our solution must illustrate each of the SOLID principles.
-  Each team member must contribute at least one submitted pull request containing working code and tests.
-  Include a README for your repo describing the problem you're solving, the solution, and how you would improve your solution.
-  [Extra Credit] Design a CLI that allows users to interact with your application. Check out the code in lesson_10 for an example in TypeScript, or this file for an example in Java.

## The Problem

Inefficient workflow management frequently leads to confusion, miscommunication, and project delays within teams. When tasks are scattered across multiple platforms or inadequately organized, it becomes hard to see what needs to be done and who is responsible for each task. This creates an environment ripe for bottlenecks, situations where the workflow is restricted or slowed down, causing delays and negative effects to the team's overall efficiency. Therefore, having a clear and organized workflow management system is crucial for improving teamwork and ensuring projects are finished on time.

## The Solution

Our Kanban app is engineered with three powerful features to elevate team productivity and task management. 

1. **The Progress Tracker** provides users with real-time updates on task progress, fostering a goal-oriented mindset and keeping teams aligned with their objectives.
2. **The User/Task Manager** goes beyond basic task assignments, enabling role-based permissions and fostering accountability across teams by allowing managers to allocate responsibilities and monitor contributions seamlessly.
3. **The Task Board** serves as an intuitive workspace for prioritizing, organizing, and tracking tasks to meet deadlines effectively, ensuring every team member is focused on what matters most. 

Together, these features create a cohesive, productivity-driven experience that adapts to any project environment, making our Kanban app a valuable tool for teams aiming to optimize their workflows and achieve exceptional outcomes

## How To Improve

To enhance the functionality and user experience of our Kanban app, several techinal improvements could be considered for future development:

- **Automated Task Prioritization** would help users focus on the most critical tasks, improving efficiency. 
- **Time Tracking** would enable users to monitor the duration of each task, promoting better time management and planning. 
- Adding **Notifications and Reminders** would ensure that team members stay updated on deadlines and task progress. 
- **Labels and Tags** would allow for better task categorization.
- **Analytics and Reporting** would offer insights into productivity trends.
- **Custom Workflow Options** would allow teams to tailor the board structure to their specific needs.
- **Integrations with Other Software** would enable seamless collaboration with other tools used in the workflow.
- An **User Interface** would make the app more intuitive, enhancing usability and overall satisfaction.
