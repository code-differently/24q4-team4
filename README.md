# Code Differently-24Q4Team4 Capstone Project(Kanban board)

### Members: Chigazo Graham, Shawn Dustmore Jr., Tommy Tran, and Zion Buchanan

## Introduction

For the next two weeks(Dec 2nd - Dec 14th), our team will ideate and implement a working software system. We will have the opportunity to apply the skills that we have learned to solve an interesting problem or contribute a meaningful tool that improves our lives.

Development will be conducted in Visual Studio Code created in JavaScript, using Git and GitHub for version control to ensure efficient team management. We will follow the full development lifecycle, from ideation to implementation, prioritizing best practices in software design and development. Our final project submission will enable the functionality described by our user stories that can be found in the 'Issues' tab to guide our development process and ensure we meet the project requirements effectively.

## Our App

Inefficient workflow management frequently leads to confusion, miscommunication, and project delays within teams. When tasks are scattered across multiple platforms or inadequately organized, it becomes hard to see what needs to be done and who is responsible for each task. This creates an environment ripe for bottlenecks, situations where the workflow is restricted or slowed down, causing delays and negative effects to the team's overall efficiency. Therefore, having a clear and organized workflow management system is crucial for improving teamwork and ensuring projects are finished on time.

## Project Requirements

-  All work must be submitted in our team's assigned GitHub repository.
-  The assignment can be completed in **ANY** language.
-  Must have a working front-end that interacts with a back-end web service to retrieve and persist data.
-  App must be publicly accessible. It is recommended that we use Vercel or Fly.io to deploy apps.
-  The system must incorporate one third-party API.
-  Write unit tests achieving **70% code coverage** (using JaCoCo for Java or Jest for Typescript).
-  Must include an integration test for each user story that demonstrates how our code implements the desired feature.
-  Each team member must contribute at least **two** submitted pull request containing working code and tests.
-  Repo must include a README with the following elements:
    - The team
    - Screenshot
    - A description of the app
    - Demo link
    - Installation instructions
    - Known issues
    - Roadmap features
    - Credits
- [Tip] It is **HIGHLY** recommended that you maintain a clean Main branch and only merge changes via pull requests (we've been using squashed merges for the main repo to simplify commit history). Don't forget to use Conventional Commits.

## Presentation Requirements(Delete Section Upon Project Completion)

For your presentation, you will be given up to 20 minutes to feature your project. Each person on the team should have a speaking role. Here's what your presentation will contain:

- Up to four slides of content, then a live demo walkthrough.
- Your presentation should cover the following items, in order:
    - Introduce team members and their roles
    - State the problem your attempting to solve
    - State how your app is designed to solve the problem
    - Show your demo
    - Discuss how you'd like to enhance in the future
    - Lastly, talk through technical challenges and features.
- You will be given 5 minutes for Q&A and take questions from the audience.
