# Code-Differently 24q4-team4 Project Kanban(OOP Project)

### Members: Chigazo Graham, Shawn Dustmore Jr., Tommy Tran, Zion Buchanan  

## Introduction

This project aims to create a solution for a real-world challenge by utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and adhering to SOLID design principles. We strive to build a software application that is both scalable and maintainable, enhancing code reusability and collaboration while boosting overall productivity. Ultimately, our goal is to deliver a high-quality product that effectively addresses user needs and can easily adapt to future requirements.

This development will be carried out in Visual Studio Code using [coding language]. To facilitate effective teamwork and maintain efficient code management, we are leveraging Git and GitHub for version control. Throughout the project, we will explore the complete development lifecycle, from the initial ideation phase to final implementation, with a strong focus on best practices in software design and development.

## Prerequisites

> Before starting work on our project, we have three user stories as feature requests in our assigned GitHub repo within the issues tab. These will need to be approved by the instructor, Anthony D. Mays, before we can begin coding. Our final project submission will enable the functionality described by our user stories. Once approved, we will prioritize these user stories to guide our development process and ensure we meet the project requirements effectively.

## The Problem
'''
Inefficient workflow management frequently leads to confusion, miscommunication, and project delays within teams. When tasks are scattered across multiple platforms or inadequately organized, it becomes hard to see what needs to be done and who is responsible for each task. This creates an environment ripe for bottlenecks, situations where the workflow is restricted or slowed down, causing delays and negative effects to the team's overall efficiency. Therefore, having a clear and organized workflow management system is crucial for improving teamwork and ensuring projects are finished on time.
'''
## The Solution
'''
* [Include a short explanation of how we are applying each of the SOLID principles in our project to demonstrate a deeper understanding of software design.]
* [If applicable, mention how the Kanban board will enhance user experience or meet user needs. Highlighting the end-user benefits can be appealing.]
* [If you can include any metrics or results from user testing (if conducted), it can provide evidence of Our projectâ€™s effectiveness.]
'''
## How To Improve
'''
* [Discuss any planned features or improvements, showcasing your commitment to ongoing development and responsiveness to user feedback.]

'''

## Project Requirements

- [] All work must be submitted in our team's assigned GitHub repository.
- [] The assignment can be completed in TypeScript or in Java.
- [] Must include at least 5 types of objects with meaningful relationships to each other.
- [] One of your objects must be a custom data structure that provides for adding, removing, and updating items in a collection.
- [] Implement at least two custom exceptions.
- [] Write unit tests achieving 90% code coverage (using JaCoCo for Java or Jest for Typescript).
- [] Must include an integration test for each user story that demonstrates how your code implements the desired feature.
- [] Our solution must illustrate each of the SOLID principles.
- [] Each team member must contribute at least one submitted pull request containing working code and tests.
- [] Include a README for your repo describing the problem you're solving, the solution, and how you would improve your solution.
